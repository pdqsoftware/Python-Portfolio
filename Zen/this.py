import this

"""
The 'import this' statement in Python simply prints The Zen of Python guidelines to the console. It's not a standard
import of a module, but a special case that displays a philosophical text about Python's design principles.

Here is a breakdown of how it works:
1. It is NOT a Module:
The this in import this isn't a regular module name. It's a built-in feature of the Python interpreter.
2. Prints the Zen:
When you execute import this, the Python interpreter doesn't try to find a module named this. Instead, it directly
prints the Zen of Python to your console.
3. No Error:
While you might expect a syntax error, there is none. The interpreter recognizes the special instruction and executes
it, displaying the text. In essence, import this is a handy shortcut to access and display a humorous and informative
guide to Python's development philosophy.
